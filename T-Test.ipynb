We draw a random sample from the population and then compare the sample mean with the population mean and make a statistical decision as to whether or not the sample mean is different from the population mean.\n",

Basically it tells you if the sample was taken from the population. Good to test when scientist tell you that they took a random sample, one can see if this is really true. ie if you have a low p value then one can be skeptic about it."
